# CS224d - Assignment 2(Solutions)
This repository contains the implementations for:
  * Named entity recognition using deep neural networks (q2_NER.py)
  * Language Modelling using Recurrent Neural Networks (q3_RNNLM.py)
  
The code was implemented in Python, using TensorFlow. These are the solutions for the second assignment from the course "CS224d: Deep learning for Natural Language Processing", a graduate level course taken by students at Stanford University.
